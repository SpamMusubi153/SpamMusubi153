### Hello! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science (CS) at Seattle University.

I believe that programming and STEM need to be informed by the **humanities** to be more *accessible, inclusive, and beneficial to all*.

I am currently working on exploring this type of intersection with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
